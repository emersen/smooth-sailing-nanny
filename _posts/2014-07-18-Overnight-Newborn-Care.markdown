description: The phrase “I slept like a baby last night” has always baffled me.  Do you mean you were up multiple times throughout the night, crying, hungry and wet? A better saying would be “I slept like a teenager last night” (they sleep like logs through anything!). Get that sleep like a teenager while your infant is attentively being cared for. Rates start at $15 an hour.  How many nights a week and length of care is totally up to you!
